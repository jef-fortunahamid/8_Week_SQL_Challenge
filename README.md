# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This page offers answers for the eight case studies included in the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). All Serious SQL case studies utilised the original Docker-based PostgreSQL setup as their SQL environment.

The 8 Week SQL Challenge from Data With Danny, is a series of eight realisitic scenarios on solving business problems and answering questions with data through SQL.

This course and the 8 Week SQL challenge helped me build a solid base of SQL knowledge. Many thanks to [Data with Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/) for crafting such insightful anbd engaging SQL case studies.
